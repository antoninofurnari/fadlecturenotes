# What is Data Analysis?
The goal of this first lecture is to give an understanding of what data analysis is. We will initially keep a rather informal tone, while more formal definition will be given later in the course.

Before diving into what Data Analysis is, we need to develop at least an intuitive understanding of what data is, which is addressed in the following sections.
